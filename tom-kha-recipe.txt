You'll need:

Chicken broth,
lemongrass,
1-2 limes,
ginger,
red or panang curry paste,
mushrooms,
green beans, broken in half
tomatoes cut into quarters,
Onions, sliced into 1/2 rings
shrimp or chicken or tofu,
can of coconut milk,
basil and/or cilantro to garnish

Optional:
Coconut oil

Directions:

Start by boiling your chicken broth in a saucepan with the ginger and lemongrass.
Give it 10-20 mins for the flavors to meld.
Meanwhile, in a bigger pot, heat some oil - i like to use coconut oil - and add a heaping tablespoon of curry paste. Sautee briefly without burning.
Next add sliced mushrooms (not onions yet, you want them crisp) and fry for a few minutes to coat the shrooms in the spicy oil.
Add coconut milk and chicken broth. You can filter out the ginger and lemongrass or leave it.

Bring to a boil and add greenbeans broken in half, onions, and tomatoes. If you're using chicken add it now
(If using shrimp add at the very end and remove from heat as soon as they're cooked)
Cook until veggies are al dente
Add fish sauce and the juice of 1-2 limes. Adjust salt/sourness to taste with more fish sauce or lime

Serve with chopped basil and cilantro for garnish

That's it really. The key is not over-cooking veggies. And get real Thai curry paste

You can add some lime zest for extra zing
